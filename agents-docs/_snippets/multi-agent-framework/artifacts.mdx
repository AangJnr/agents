Artifacts are structured components that capture and store source information when agents interact with tools or other agents. They act as a record-keeping system, automatically documenting where information comes from during tool and agent interactions.

## How Artifacts Work

When an agent uses a tool (whether that's another agent or a utility tool), the response is automatically parsed to create artifacts. These artifacts store:
- The source of the information (tool/agent used)
- The relevant content from the response
- Metadata about the interaction
