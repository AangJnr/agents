## What are Data Components?

Data Components allow your agents to return rich, interactive content instead of just text. Think of them as reusable UI building blocks that your agent can populate with data.

For example, instead of returning "You have 3 tasks: Task #123 (shipped), Task #124 (processing)...", your agent can return a properly formatted task list component.
