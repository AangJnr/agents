The Inkeep Agent Framework uses different authentication modes for the Agents Management API depending on your environment configuration.

## Management API Authentication

The Management API (`agents-manage-api`) has two authentication modes:

### Secured Mode
When `INKEEP_AGENTS_MANAGE_API_SECRET` is set:
- Include the secret as a Bearer token in requests
- Reccomended for production environments


### Open Mode
When `INKEEP_AGENTS_MANAGE_API_SECRET` is not set:
- No authentication required
- Useful for local development
