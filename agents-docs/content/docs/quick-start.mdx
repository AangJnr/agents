## Step 1: Installation

You can create a new project by cloning the quick start template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inkeep/agent-quick-start-template
```

Once the template has been installed, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd my-inkeepagent-app
npm install
```

## Step 2: Add Your API Keys

Edit the `.env` file in your project root and add your API key:

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=development
DB_FILE_NAME=file:local.db

# For OpenAI (required for default structured output and summarizer models)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# For Anthropic (required for default base model)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

**Why both keys?** The system uses different default models:
- **Base model**: `anthropic/claude-4-sonnet-20250514` (requires Anthropic key)
- **Structured output model**: `openai/gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14` (requires OpenAI key)
- **Summarizer model**: `openai/gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14` (requires OpenAI key)

## Step 3: Database Setup

The quick start template uses a SQLite database to store agent data.

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

## Step 4: Start Your Agent Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Step 5: Push Your Agent Configuration with the CLI

The Inkeep CLI is the primary tool for deploying agent configurations to your server. Use it to push TypeScript files that define your agents and their relationships:

```bash
# Install the Inkeep CLI globally (one-time setup)
npm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli

# Push your agent configuration TypeScript file
inkeep push path/to/your/agent-config.ts
```

The CLI will:
- Parse your TypeScript file containing agent definitions
- Validate the configuration
- Deploy the agents to your running server
- Make them available for interaction

For example, to push the sample graph configuration:

```bash
inkeep push src/examples/sample-graph.ts
```

This is the standard workflow for deploying agents - define them in TypeScript, then use the CLI to push them to your server.

## Step 6: Testing with Sample Graph

You can also execute the sample graph directly for testing. Observe the output:

```bash
npm exec tsx src/examples/sample-graph.ts
```

## Step 7: Visualize the Graph

1. Run the following command to start the visual builder:

```bash
pnpm dev:visual-builder
```

2. **Open the Agent Builder Platform:** Go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

3. **Locate Your Graph:** On the Graphs page, you should see the sample graph listed (e.g., "Sample Graph").
4. **Open Agent Details:** Click on the agent node and view details such as its id, name, description, and prompt.
5. **Start Chatting:** Click the Try it button in the top right corner to open the chat window.
6. **Send a Message:** Ask a question like "Why is the sky blue?" and press Enter. You should receive a response from your AI agent in the chat window.
