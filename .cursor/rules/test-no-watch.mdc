# Test Commands Without Watch Mode

When running tests, use the `--run` flag to avoid watch mode:

- `pnpm test --run` - Run all tests once and exit
- `pnpm test --run src/__tests__/agents/` - Run specific directory tests once and exit  
- `pnpm test --run <specific-test-file>` - Run specific test file once and exit

This prevents tests from getting stuck in watch mode where you need to press 'q' to quit.
